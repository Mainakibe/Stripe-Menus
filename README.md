# Stripe Menus Project

In this project i created a React app with CRUD functionality. It enables you to add items into your shopping cart, decreasing the number of items on your cart, delete an item from your cart and clear your entire cart.

## Tech used: React.js

The project was mainly focused on sharpening my skills in using the useReducer and useContext React hooks.

## Optimizations
When I improve this project, I would add a search search bar. I would also add the date and time the item was added to the cart and the checkout feature as well.

## Lessons Learned:
Use the same naming convention for in your reducer action type as you would use when adding the functionality in dispatch type.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
